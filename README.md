# Police interventions

This python app produces a single bar plot showing the level of activity by town of a police service within a region in the province of Quebec (Canada), in comparison to the % of the population of each town of the region.

This plot is produced on a monthly basis.

The program uses the Python library *docx2txt* to convert daily police activity reports produced
in Microsoft word by the police administration service into a txt file that is parsed to find all police interventions for each town of a region.



## Getting Started

The file requirements.txt contains the packages/dependencies to use in your virtual python environment and a dozen of daily police reports are included as input files to the program for convenience. _(The police daily reports never contain any nominative information)_

Using Python 3 in a virtual environment:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the program


```
$ python analyze.py
```
